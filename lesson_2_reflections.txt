What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

>When we initialize a repository it becomes a git thingy. Otherwise it wont be a git thingy.
Initialized repo's can be used to do git stuff like commits i.e do version control. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do 
you think it offers?

> Staging area is the intermediate area where files can be added before commiting it. The value 
it offers is that I can decide what files to commit at a time, add message and stuff. 
Working directory is the place where we do work, where files are saved etc.
